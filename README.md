### Interest in IT 

1.I'm a big fan of computer games since I was 7 years old. Because my older brother bought a computer and he told me these awesome games are created by people who work in IT. After that, I secretly vowed to be a people who can produce games. However, I would like to be a networking security manager, when I watched some hacker movies.

### Personal Profile
1.ENTP

Inventive, clever, and enthusiastic, you are always on the lookout for new possibilities and problems to stimulate and challenge your inner world of ideas. You are curious in regard to everything that is new and you seldom feel at ease with the status quo. You have a great need for intellectual novelty, and from time to time you may even challenge people or organizations just to squeeze some new idea out of them. You tend to have a love of discussions and verbal sparring, and in a discussion you may follow an argument to its most extreme conclusion. In such cases you may even be suspected of being provocative for the sake of it. When a truly new idea manages to take hold of your imagination, you are quick to see how that idea could be turned into a project in the real world. You have a great enthusiasm for such projects. The problem is that you have such a vivid imagination that you may sometimes start more projects than it is humanly possible to finish.

2.I'm a Visual learner! 
If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.

As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.

### Project ideas

I would like to develop a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2  or Cocos24 because I'm really in games.All the game fans want to play the game they have made by themselves. It will be very fulfilling. You can also add your own ideas.When your friends play your game, you can also be proud to tell him that this is the game you made and you can also develop what you want with many friends who share your interests.Therefore, I want to make a plan to achieve this project.

Firstly, if I want to achieve this plan, I need to have a lot of skills.For example, it will need java developer and lots of knowledge. I will learn some basic knowledge first. Then, I will learn some advanced knowledge step by step. Secondly, I need to make the most of my spare time.For illustrate, I will communicate with some friends and learn some skills frome them.Findly, online classes are also necessary. That is my plan.
