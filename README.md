### Interest in IT 

1.I'm a big fan of computer games since I was 7 years old. Because my older brother bought a computer and he told me these awesome games are created by people who work in IT. After that, I secretly vowed to be a people who can produce games. However, I would like to be a networking security manager, when I watched some hacker movies.
